# email-handler
Handles the contact form on my [portfolio website](https://ibrahimpg.com) by sending a copy of the submission to both myself and the sender. Can easily be modified to fit other web apps and use cases as well as dropped into a REST API or fullstack app in order to send confirmation emails during registration and other cool stuff like that.
