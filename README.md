# email-handler
Handles the contact form on my [portfolio website](https://ibrahimpg.com) by sending a copy of the submission to the sender (which shows up in my sent folder. It can be modified to send the email to the both of us instead, or include me in the bcc). Built with Express and Nodemailer. Can easily be modified and dropped into larger Node/Express apps in order to send confirmation emails during registration and other cool stuff like that.
