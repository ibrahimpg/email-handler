# email-handler
Handles the contact form on my [portfolio website](https://ibrahimpg.com) by sending a copy of the submission to both myself and the sender. Built with Express and Nodemailer. Can easily be modified and dropped into larger Node/Express apps in order to send confirmation emails during registration and other cool stuff like that.
